Determining Correlation Between Wikipedia Categories Based on Shortest Path of Hyperlinks 

Abstract:
Wikipedia is a web service that provides a free encyclopedia that is available for all to use. Hyperlinks are used to connect two articles that have similar or related content. The Stanford Network Analysis Project created a dataset to model Wikipedia hyperlink structure and hyperlinked articles, further grouped into categories of related articles. This project seeks to understand underlying connections between these categories based on the average shortest path length of hyperlinks between articles of different categories, specifically the most popular and a random set. Results exhibit evidence to support related categories will have similar rank structure as well as average path lengths when being compared against a set of categories indicating there may be a deeper link between related categories and average shortest path length.
